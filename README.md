![RSMQ: Redis Simple Message Queue for Node.js](https://img.webmart.de/rsmq_wide.png)

# Redis Simple Message Queue
A lightweight message queue for Node.js that requires no dedicated queue server. Just a Redis server.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/smrchy/rsmq.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/smrchy/rsmq)
[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/smrchy/rsmq.svg)](https://david-dm.org/smrchy/rsmq)

**tl;dr:** If you run a Redis server and currently use Amazon SQS or a similar message queue you might as well use this fast little replacement. Using a shared Redis server multiple Node.js processes can send / receive messages.

## Features
* Lightweight: **Just Redis** and ~500 lines of javascript.
* Speed: Send/receive 10000+ messages per second on an average machine. It's **just Redis**.
* Guaranteed **delivery of a message to exactly one recipient** within a messages visibility timeout.
* Received messages that are not deleted will reappear after the visibility timeout.
* [Test coverage](http://travis-ci.org/smrchy/rsmq)
* A message is deleted by the message id. The message id is returned by the `sendMessage` and `receiveMessage` method.
* Messages stay in the queue unless deleted.
* Optional RESTful interface via [rest-rsmq](https://github.com/smrchy/rest-rsmq)
* Typescript Typings ❤️
* Optional Promise-based API (only if `Promise` is defined), just suffix your method with `Async`, eg: `sendMessage` -> `sendMessageAsync`, all queue methods are supported

**Note:** RSMQ uses the Redis EVAL command (LUA scripts) so the minimum Redis version is 2.6+. 

## Usage
* After creating a queue you can send messages to that queue.
* The messages will be handled in a **FIFO** (first in first out) manner unless specified with a delay.
* Every message has a unique `id` that you can use to delete the message. 
* The `sendMessage` method will return the `id` for a sent message.
* The `receiveMessage` method will return an `id` along with the message and some stats.
* Should you not delete the message it will be eligible to be received again after the visibility timeout is reached.
* Please have a look at the `createQueue` and `receiveMessage` methods described below for optional parameters like **visibility timeout** and **delay**.

## Installation
`npm install rsmq`

## Modules for RSMQ
To keep the core of *RSMQ* small additional functionality is available as modules:

* [**rsmq-worker**](https://github.com/mpneuried/rsmq-worker) Helper to implement a worker with RSMQ.
* [**rest-rsmq**](https://github.com/smrchy/rest-rsmq) A RESTful interface for RSMQ.
* [**rsmq-cli**](https://github.com/mpneuried/rsmq-cli) A command-line interface / Terminal client for RSMQ.
* [**rsmq-promise-native**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsmq-promise-native) Native promise interface for RSMQ.
* [**rsmq-promise**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsmq-promise) Promise interface for RSMQ (via Bluebird).

## RSMQ in other languages

The simplicity of RSMQ is useful in other languages. Here is a list of implementations in other languages:

* [**Rust**](https://github.com/Couragium/rsmq-async-rs) RSMQ Async for Rust. See [#107](https://github.com/smrchy/rsmq/issues/107)
* [**Java**](https://github.com/igr/jrsmq) RSMQ for Java. See [#48](https://github.com/smrchy/rsmq/issues/48)
* [**PHP**](https://github.com/michsindelar/PhpRSMQ) RSMQ for PHP (work in progress)
* [**CSharp/DotNet**](https://github.com/tontonrally/rsmqCsharp) RSMQ for .NET

Note: Should you plan to port RSQM to another language please make sure to have tests to ensure compatibility with all RSMQ clients. And of course: let me know so i can mention your port here.

	} else {
		console.log("No messages for me...")
	}
});
```

#### changeMessageVisibility(options, callback)
Change the visibility timer of a single message.
The time when the message will be visible again is calculated from the current time (now) + `vt`.

rsmq.changeMessageVisibility({ qname: "myqueue", vt: "60", id: "dhoiwpiirm15ce77305a5c3a3b0f230c6e20f09b55" }, function (err, resp) {
	if (err) {
		console.error(err)
		return
	}

	if (resp === 1) {
		console.log("message hidden for 60 seconds")
	}
});
```

    
### quit(callback)
Disconnect the redis client.
This is only useful if you are using rsmq within a script and want node to be able to exit.

## Realtime
When [initializing](#initialize) RSMQ you can enable the realtime PUBLISH for new messages. On every new message that gets sent to RSQM via `sendMessage` a Redis PUBLISH will be issued to `{rsmq.ns}:rt:{qname}`.

Example for RSMQ with default settings:

* The queue `testQueue` already contains 5 messages.
* A new message is being sent to the queue `testQueue`.
* The following Redis command will be issued: `PUBLISH rsmq:rt:testQueue 6`

### How to use the realtime option
Besides the PUBLISH when a new message is sent to RSMQ nothing else will happen. Your app could use the Redis SUBSCRIBE command to be notified of new messages and issue a `receiveMessage` then. However make sure not to listen with multiple workers for new messages with SUBSCRIBE to prevent multiple simultaneous `receiveMessage` calls.
